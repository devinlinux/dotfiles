# Neovim Config

This neovim config is made to make neovim more like an ide than a text editor. Although the intent was to make it similar to and ide, some essential
features from the normal configuration were kept such as no mouse compatability

Feel free to use this for your neovim config although you will probably want to change the footer in alpha.lua where I have my name (You might want to
put yours or something else)
