# Dotfiles

This repo includes all of the meaningful files in the .config folder of my Arch Linux installation. Included in this repository are my i3 config and my neovim config. 

## Arch Linux using i3 gaps
I have not modified my i3 config very much from the default config, but some of the changes I made wsa: adding autotiling, adding a wallpaper using feh, and removing the borders that are found on the different windows

## Neovim
My neovim configuration, made to look like vscode in terms of the colorscheme. I also added vim tree to see what files are in the directory that I am working in
